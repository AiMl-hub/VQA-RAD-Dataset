Soon after, she had a “full attack” where she experienced aphasia and lower limb paralysis. She remained an inpatient for two weeks. This stay was followed by steroids and a trial of Tysabri. She had to discontinue Tysabri with pregnancy four years ago. This caused her to experience another exacerbation, namely diffuse shaking tremors .

This was followed by bilateral knee pain and subsequently left arm pain; these pains “never went away.” Her primary physician diagnosed her with MS. Soon after, she had a “full attack” where she experienced aphasia and lower limb paralysis. She remained an inpatient for two weeks. This stay was followed by steroids and a trial of Tysabri. She had to discontinue Tysabri with pregnancy four years ago. This caused her to experience another exacerbation, namely diffuse shaking tremors . Until four years ago, patient had also experienced episodes of sciatic nerve paresthesias, ocular blindness, seizures, and daily bowel incontinence. From four year ago until the present, patient had clinical depression but no other MS symptoms.\n",

Immediately following the accident, she reports loss of sensation in her lower extremities bilaterally, shortness of breath, bilateral loss of vision, and back pain. She was not however admitted to the hospital. Since the accident she experiences daily frontal headaches which are throbbing, associated with photophobia and occasional syncope, and relieved by ibuprofen.

On the lateral radiograph, the depressed minor fissure and depressed posterior portion of the major fissures produce a sharp interface with the overaerated upper lobe, and partial silhouetting of the right hemidiphragm is again noted. LEFT LUNG: On the frontal radiograph, there is a new wedge-shaped, triangular left retrocardiac opacity, and the previously noted left mid lung zone granuloma is no longer visualized (“shifting granuloma sign”). Also noted is the so-called “vascular nodule sign:” the appearance of multiple nodular opacities in the left perihilar area which represent visualization of multiple upper lung pulmonary vessels seen on-end as they are reoriented due to compensatory left upper lobe expansion to occupy the space previously occupied by the now collapsed left lower lobe. The lateral examination demonstrates a wedge-shaped/triagular opacity over the lower thoracic spine with partial silhouetting of the left hemidiaphragm.\n",

Husband noticed that her right UE and LE began shaking in what he describes as repeated “flexion and extension” movements. When husband tried to ask what was wrong, pt was unresponsive and continued to seize for approx 5 minutes. Husband states that wife’s mouth began to contort and she drooled on herself. Denies any tongue biting or urinary incontinence. Paramedics arrived and pt was resistant to them, later stating that she thought it was a homeless man trying to drag her out of her car. She became oriented and responsive soon after, stating that she felt like she was in a dream during the episode where she could hear everything being said but could not speak or open her eyes.

Multiple small acute and subacute infarcts were identified in the right parietal lobe. Pt was asymptomatic and hemodynamically stable throughout her stay at an outside hosptial. She was transferred to our MICU tonight for monitoring and further work-up of her new onset seizure and CVA. She has had multiple admissions over the past 4 weeks which have revealed several findings of unclear etiology, including transudative left pleural effusion prompting CT and PET scan showing PE, LV thrombus, hypermetabolic lymph nodes and left lung mass, and echo that showed EF<20% with dyskinetic LV walls. Her course has been complicated by CVA with MRI showing acute/subacute infarcts consistent with diffuse embolic stroke. Hypercoagulable and Rheumatologic work ups have been unremarkable.

            "48 yo woman who was admitted to outside hospital for a seizure (reported by husband, while driving home after discharge for CHF. PMH complicated, including recently diagnosed with new onset CHF (Stage IV, EF <20%), L ventricular mural thrombus, R pulmonary embolism, L-sided pleural effusion s/p thoracentesis (transudative w/negative cytology), and multiple renal infarct w/o unifying diagnosis. Husband noticed that her right UE and LE began shaking in what he describes as repeated “flexion and extension” movements. When husband tried to ask what was wrong, pt was unresponsive and continued to seize for approx 5 minutes. Husband states that wife’s mouth began to contort and she drooled on herself. Denies any tongue biting or urinary incontinence. Paramedics arrived and pt was resistant to them, later stating that she thought it was a homeless man trying to drag her out of her car. She became oriented and responsive soon after, stating that she felt like she was in a dream during the episode where she could hear everything being said but could not speak or open her eyes. She was taken by ambulance to outside Hospital ICU and by the time she arrived was fully AOx3 and communicating without any e/o focal neurologic deficits.\n",
